## 📁 Project Structure

- `ipl_anlaysis_visuals.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing full analysis, cleaning steps, and visualizations.
- `data/` – Folder to store input IPL datasets (e.g., matches.csv).
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt` – List of dependencies (optional).

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess IPL match data
- Analyze team and player performances
- Visualize trends across IPL seasons
- Examine win patterns and venue impact

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

---

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

The dataset contained null values in key columns such as:

- `city`
- `player_of_match`
- `winner`
- `result_margin`
- `target_runs`
- `target_overs`
- `method`

These were handled using a combination of replacement, deletion, and type conversion techniques for consistency and usability.
Also some corrupt datas were handled.
